										<p class="description"><strong>Description: </strong>I've used Sanebox for a couple years, and it's pretty great. The idea is that it pre-sorts your email for you, putting less important stuff in a "Later" folder, and newsletter emails and the like in a "News" folder. This filters out the less important emails so that your inbox stays more manageable. Those other emails are still easy to get to, they just don't distract you constantly anymore. Using Sanebox plus having my iPhone only check email every 15 minutes really reduced email distraction on the go. I only see stuff worth seeing. And it's easy to train the system, in case it puts important stuff in the Later folder, or if it's allowing non-important stuff to make its way to the inbox.
